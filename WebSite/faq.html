    <div class="qu">Is there an "official" Mardi Gras?
        <div class="an">No! Mardi Gras is a holiday, just like Christmas and Easter. It belongs to everyone. Do not
            believe the claims of
            businesses who offer "official" Mardi Gras merchandise or an "official" Mardi Gras website. Using the term
            “official” is
            just a way for vendors to sell their products or services to those who do not know better. Products or
            websites are not
            licensed by the government for Mardi Gras. Each individual parade krewe is responsible for all of its
            merchandise. In
            some parts of the country, official organizations control their Mardi Gras celebration, but this is not true
            in New
            Orleans.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="qu">When does Mardi Gras start and end?
        <div class="an">The Carnival season always begins on Jan. 6, which is King’s Day (Feast of the Epiphany). Mardi
            Gras day (Fat Tuesday),
            however, is on a different day each year.

            Fat Tuesday changes every year because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday each year. Fat Tuesday is
            always the
            day before Ash Wednesday.

            Most visitors plan to arrive no later than the Saturday prior to Mardi Gras day and stay through Ash
            Wednesday. Check
            out our dates page to see when Fat Tuesday will fall through the next few years.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="qu">What is the weather usually like during Mardi Gras? What should I pack?
        <div class="an">The weather during Mardi Gras can vary from very cold to very warm, almost hot. Sometimes it
            will change from one
            extreme to the other during the same day. It’s a good idea to layer your clothes since a chilly morning may
            turn into a
            warm afternoon.

            Since you will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and clothes that can get somewhat
            dirty. Don’t
            forget to check the forecast for rain. If storms are predicted, then you’ll definitely want to bring a
            raincoat!</div>
    </div>
    <div class="qu">Where can I book a room with a balcony to watch the parades go by?
        <div class="an">The best option is to reserve a package in the French Quarter or along the parade route that
            offers a balcony, food and
            a bathroom pass.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="qu">How much does it cost to go to Mardi Gras?
        <div class="an">It's free! Not only that, but you'll leave with bags of Mardi Gras beads and throws. That's why
            we call it the "Greatest
            Free Show on Earth!"</div>
    </div>
    <div class="qu">I only have limited time. What is the prime time to visit during Mardi Gras?
        <div class="an">The weekend before Fat Tuesday is the prime time to visit New Orleans for Mardi Gras. This is
            the weekend when Bacchus
            and Endymion, two of the biggest parades of the season, roll down the streets of New Orleans. The streets
            are packed all
            day Saturday and Sunday with parade watchers. If you can stay longer than a weekend, Monday (Lundi Gras) and
            Fat Tuesday
            are also great days to experience Mardi Gras. Orpheus, another big parade, rolls on that Monday night, and
            the Zulu
            Lundi Gras festival goes on all day. On Fat Tuesday, walking around the French Quarter and seeing all of the
            costumes
            and masks is a unique and thrilling experience.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="qu">What happens if there is bad weather?
        <div class="an">The parades roll in light rain. The officials will only postpone if the weather is predicted to
            be severe. The local TV
            and radio news stations (such as WWL Radio) broadcast the hour by hour updates.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="qu">Can I bring my kids to Mardi Gras?
        <div class="an">By all means, yes! Contrary to public perception, Mardi Gras is a family celebration. Those of
            us who grew up in New
            Orleans feel guilty once our children have grown up and we continue going to every parade, because we used
            to use
            "taking the children" as our excuse! Bring big bags (even large garbage bags!) to hold all of the stuff they
            will catch.
            Throws often include toys, stuffed animals, beads and more.

            The only place you should avoid with kids is the French Quarter (where no full-size parades pass anyway). We
            recommend
            seeing the parades when they begin on St. Charles Avenue near Napoleon, since parades can last until 11 p.m.
            near the
            end of the route. The Garden District portion of St. Charles is a family area where you will see many
            families staking
            out their parade watching position, having picnics, playing ball, and having fun under the beautiful oak
            trees. You
            don't have to worry about the streetcars, as they stop running in this area during Mardi Gras.

            You may also want to consider taking your kids to the parades in the suburban areas like Metairie, which is
            only 10
            minutes away from New Orleans. Metairie's Caesar parade, the Saturday before Mardi Gras weekend, is the
            parade
            Disneyworld features on Mardi Gras day. Kids love it!</div>
    </div>
    <div class="qu">Do I need tickets?
        <div class="an">There is no need for tickets to see a parade...all of them are FREE!! That is why it is called "The Greatest Free Show
        on Earth!". You only get tickets if you want to sit down on stands as the parades pass.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qu">Are Carnival and Mardi Gras the same thing?
        <div class="an">Technically, "Carnival" refers to the period of feasting and fun that begins on January 6 (see question below) and ends
        on Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday), the final day of revelry before Ash Wednesday when Lent begins. It is also common for
        people to refer to the entire season as Mardi Gras and, for clarity, to call Fat Tuesday "Mardi Gras Day." Locals tend
        to call the season "Carnival" and, to us, the last two weekends leading up to Tuesday are"Mardi Gras."</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qu">What is Twelfth Night?
        <div class="an">Twelfth Night (aka, the Feast of the Epiphany and Three Kings' Day) is January 6th and is the official start of Mardi
        Gras every year. While the date of Fat Tuesday changes, Twelfth Night does not.

    </div>
    <div class="qu">When was the first Mardi Gras?
        <div class="an">The first Mardi Gras parade was held in New Orleans on Feb. 24, 1857 by the Krewe of Comus. They began the tradition of
        presenting a parade with floats and following it with a ball for the krewe and their guests.

    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="qu">What is the significance of the Mardi Gras colors, and where did they come from?
        <div class="an">Rex, the King of Carnival, selected the Mardi Gras colors and assigned meaning to them in 1892. Purple stands for
        justice, green for faith, and gold for power.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="qu">Why are masks worn?
        <div class="an">By law, float riders must always have a mask on. On Fat Tuesday, masking is legal for everyone else, and the elaborate
        masks that some wear add to the fun.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="qu">How is a king chosen?
        <div class="an">The method of selecting a king varies from krewe to krewe. Some krewes hold random drawings, while others invite a
        celebrity guest to be their king. Rex, the King of Carnival, is chosen by the School of Design, who sponsors the Rex
        parade. His identity is revealed the day before the parade.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="qu">How does Mardi Gras benefit the New Orleans economy?
        <div class="an">Economic impact reports indicate that Mardi Gras generates over $1 billion in annual spending.</div>
