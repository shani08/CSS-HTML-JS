                <br><br><br><br>
                <p>LaToya Cantrell (born April 3, 1972) is an American politician serving as the Mayor of New Orleans,
                    Louisiana, a post
                    she has held since May 7, 2018. Cantrell, a Democrat, is the first woman to hold the post. Before
                    becoming
                    mayor,
                    Cantrell represented District B on the New Orleans City Council from 2012–2018.</p>
<br><br>
                <h4>Political Career</h4>
<br><br>
                <h5>New Orleans City Council</h5>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    In 2012, Cantrell declared her candidacy for the New Orleans City Council seat vacated when former
                    District
                    B representative Stacy Head won an election to an at-large position.
                    After the November election, candidate Dana Kaplan and Cantrell advanced to a December runoff, which
                    Cantrell won with 54 percent of the vote. Cantrell served out the
                    balance of Head's term, and was unopposed for a full four-year term in 2014.

                    As a council member, Cantrell focused on health, housing, and criminal-justice issues. She
                    introduced a bill
                    banning smoking at restaurants and bars within New Orleans, citing the health effects of secondhand
                    smoke on
                    service industry workers. The council unanimously passed the bill in 2015.

                    Also in 2015, Cantrell began work to open a low-barrier homeless shelter, a move that was objected
                    to by
                    residents because of its proposed placement in Central City, New Orleans. Instead, the shelter was
                    moved to
                    the downtown site of the former VA Hospital.
                    In 2017, Cantrell introduced legislation with at-large council member Jason Williams to
                    register and inspect rental units in the city.

                    As a member of the Criminal Justice Committee, Cantrell has participated in efforts to install crime
                    cameras
                    in her district, assess the effectiveness of citywide anti-gun-violence campaigns, and address
                    understaffing
                    at the New Orleans Police Department.
                </p>
<br><br>
                <h5>2017 mayoral election</h5>
<br><br>

                <p>
                    Cantrell declared her candidacy for mayor of New Orleans in March 2017 in a race to replace
                    term-limited
                    mayor Mitch Landrieu. An open primary was held on October 14 and included 18 candidates. Cantrell
                    garnered
                    the most votes, winning 39% of the total.
                    In the November 18 runoff election, Cantrell defeated fellow Democratic opponent Desiree
                    Charbonnet, a former municipal judge, with 60% of the vote. She is the first woman to lead New
                    Orleans in
                    its 300-year history, as well as the first mayor not born in the city since Vic Schiro.
                </p>
<br><br>
                <h5>Mayor of New Orleans</h5>
<br><br>
                <p>
                    Cantrell was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to hold the position in the city's
                    history. Once in office, she established a new Office of Youth and Families, with the goal of
                    creating a
                    strategic plan to address families in crisis in the city. Cantrell also founded a Gun Violence
                    Reduction
                    Council tasked with finding solutions to
                    violent crime. Starting with a push to rededicate hotel taxes collected within the city for city
                    use,
                    Cantrell has focused on her fairshare initiative to improve city infrastructure, public
                    transportation,
                    public parks, and green spaces. As part of that initiative, in October 2018 the City of New Orleans
                    filed a
                    lawsuit against four opioid manufacturers and distributors.

                    During the 2019 session of the Louisiana Legislature, Cantrell negotiated the Fair Share Agreement
                    with
                    Governor John Bel Edwards and city, state, and tourism officials. The agreement secured $50 million
                    in
                    upfront funding for the city's infrastructure needs as well as $26 million in annual recurring
                    revenue for
                    the city. Following the
                    approval of the Fair Share Agreement, New Orleans voters approved three of the four proposals Mayor
                    Cantrell
                    and the City Council put on the ballot in the 2019 general election. Voters approved a $500 million
                    bond
                    sale and a tax on short-term rental
                    properties, as well the establishment of a Human Right Commission under the New Orleans Home Rule
                    Charter.

                <p>
                    The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans.
                    Celebrations
                    are concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday
                    (the
                    start of lent in the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day
                    (weather
                    permitting) many days have several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place
                    the last
                    five days of the Mardi Gras season. In the final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and
                    surrounding communities, including parades and balls (some of them masquerade balls).
<br><br>
                <h5>The social clubs</h5>
<br><br>
                The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes. most follow the same parade
                schedule
                and route each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest, Rex,
                the
                Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well known for holding
                large
                parades and events, such as the Krewe of Endymion (which is best known for naming celebrities as grand
                marshals
                for their parades), the Krewe of Bacchus (similarly known for naming celebrities as their Kings), as
                well as the
                Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club—a predominantly African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss
                throws
                into the crowds. The most common throws are strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated
                plastic
                "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small inexpensive toys. Major krewes
                follow the same parade schedule and route each year.

                While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades originate
                in the
                Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the
                upriver side
                of the French Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du Vieux and Chewbacchus - also take
                place
                downtown in the Faubourg Marigny and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras day. Mardi Gras
                day
                traditionally concludes with the "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus.
